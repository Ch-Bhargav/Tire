Trie Data Structure in C++

This project implements a Trie (prefix tree) data structure in C++ for efficient word storage and retrieval. It supports operations like inserting words, searching for exact words, checking if any words start with a given prefix, and displaying all words stored in the Trie.

Commands to Use

Compile the Code

To compile the code, use the following command:

g++ -std=c++11 -o trie main.cpp

Run the Program

After compilation, run the program with the command:

./trie

Example Usage

The program demonstrates inserting words into the Trie, searching for words, checking prefixes, and displaying all stored words. You can modify main.cpp to test the Trie with different words and operations.

This version includes just the essential details and commands.
